                    <p>Three years ago I was stuck in middle-management with a fridge full of spoiling Blue Apron meals and two weeks of unclaimed dry cleaning.<br><br> When that compulsory glass of wine after work stopped bringing me comfort, I started practicing gratitude and meditation. <br><br> Now I’m a holistic health coach for women who struggle to find balance in their everyday schedules.</p>
